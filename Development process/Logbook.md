# IOT LOGBOOK
## Week 1
This week I set up my GitHub and all necessary things that was needed for it. The blueprint I decided to do is the Weather station and ordered some parts for it. 
I ordered a 1.3inch SPI TFT LCD Display RGB to show the data of the Weather station. Ordered a speaker, 8-bit RGB LEDs and as last a micro–DC Motor. Meanwhile I made a sketch for my
Weather station that is based on a windmill. The parts for the Weather station finally came in and tested it, but the LCD Display is not working properly don't know what the problem is.
The DC motors are working fine. 
## Week 2 
This week I fixed my performance review to know What I want to do for my blueprint. I started with the making of my site thru xampp not mamp for some reason my Apache server did 
not start. I got my temperature sensor from Miquel for my Weather station plus I set up my WeMo’s for the Wi-Fi connection and is now successful. 
## Week 3 
For this week I was mostly busy with creating the site thru some tutorials on YouTube and dlo. Mainly trying to get the connection from my database to my site and WeMo’s. 
## week 4 
This week I finally have a working database with the connection to the web-application. I can now send data from the temperature sensor to database and with getdb.php file 
the website can update itself with the data of the database through the getdb.php file. I also change the KY-015 TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SENSOR MODULE for a KY-001 TEMPERATURE SENSOR MODULE
because KY-015 TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SENSOR MODULE is an analog sensor and wasn't given me accurate data, so I change to digital sensor. For the rest I worked on my poster, 
blueprint product, blueprint technical document and user manual.
