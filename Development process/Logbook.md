# IOT LOGBOOK
## Week 1
This week I set up my github and all necessary things that was needed for it.The blueprint I decided to do is the Weatherstation and orderd some parts for it. 
I orded a 1.3inch SPI TFT LCD Display RGB to show the data of the Weatherstation. Orded a speaker, 8-bit RGB LEDs and as last a micro DC Motor. Meanwhile I made a sketch for my
Weatherstation that is based on a windmill. The parts for the Weatherstation finally came in and tested it, but the LCD Display is not working properly don't know what is the problem.
The DC motors are working fine. 
## Week 2 
This week I fixed my performance review to know What I want to do for my blueprint. I started with the making of my site thru xampp not mamp for some reason my apache server did 
not start. I got my temperature sensor from miquel for my Weahter station plus plus I set up my wemos for the wifi connection and is now succefull. 
## Week 3 
For this week I was mostly busy with creating the site thru some tutorials on youtube and dlo. Mainly trying to get the connection from my database to my site and wemos.
