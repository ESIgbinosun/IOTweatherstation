# IOT LOGBOOK
## Week 1
This week I set up my github and all necessary things that was needed for it.The blueprint I decided to do is the Weatherstation and orderd some parts for it. 
I orded a 1.3inch SPI TFT LCD Display RGB to show the data of the Weatherstation. Orded a speaker, 8-bit RGB LEDs and as last a micro DC Motor. Meanwhile I made a sketch for my
Weatherstation that is based on a windmill. The parts for the Weatherstation finally came in and tested it, but the LCD Display is not working properly don't know what is the problem.
The DC motors are working fine.
